# Studas-Keeb

The idea behind this project is to create a 34 key sweep-like keyboard that costs $2 to manufacture by JLCPCB (< 100x100mm).

Initial layout renders made in KiCad have already been opened to discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/11aj9gn/is_this_layout_dumb/).

The main inspirations behind this project can be listed here:

 - [Cheapis](https://github.com/dotleon/cheapis): 100x10mm board with "universal" plates
 - [TOTEM](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/yzad7j?user_id=342139879532&web_redirect=true): Uses some SEED XIAOS as mcu.

Some similar projects that showed up on reddit:
 - [Bgkeep](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/bgkeeb): 100x100mm board that uses MX spacing
 - [Zzeneg prototype](https://imgur.com/a/5ChocCR)
